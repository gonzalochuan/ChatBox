# 3.4 Conceptual Framework

The ChatBox intranet communication platform follows the Input–Process–Output (IPO) model to organize how information flows from institutional sources to campus stakeholders. The framework clarifies how operational data feeds the system, how core modules transform that data, and what actionable outputs are delivered to users. Figure 3.1 (to be supplied) should visualize these relationships among inputs, processes, and outputs for the ChatBox environment.

During the **Input** phase, the system captures structured information from the academic community—including user accounts, role assignments, class enrollments, channel metadata, message content, and announcement targets. These artifacts originate from authenticated users, administrative staff, and synchronized institutional records.

The **Process** phase orchestrates the application’s core services. Server-side workflows authenticate users, resolve their roles, and assemble personalized channel memberships. Messaging services persist content, broadcast announcements, manage pins, and track activity logs. Business rules ensure that banners reach the intended targets, enrollment updates propagate to channels, and audit trails remain consistent. These operations collectively transform raw records into timely communications.

Finally, the **Output** phase presents consumable artifacts to end users and administrators. ChatBox renders real-time discussion threads, class or organization bulletins, notification feeds, membership rosters, and analytics dashboards summarizing engagement. These outputs empower the institution to maintain coordinated communication across cohorts while retaining historical context for compliance and decision-making.

## 3.4.1 Input

The platform aggregates inputs from users, administrators, and automated integrations. Table 3.1 summarizes the primary input categories and their contributions to the system.

Table 3.1 Inputs ingested by the ChatBox platform

| Input Category | Description | Source |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| User Profiles | Account credentials, personal details, avatars, and optional identifiers (e.g., student ID, department). | Users, registrar exports |
| Role Assignments | Role labels (student, faculty, admin) that gate features and access policies. | Administrators, HR/registrar feeds |
| Channel Metadata | Channel names, topics, and configurations for classes, offices, or interest groups. | Department coordinators, system admins |
| Enrollment Records | Links between users, subjects, and channels that control participation scopes. | Registrar feeds, faculty updates |
| Message Content | Real-time chat messages, contextual summaries, and pinned highlights. | Authenticated users |
| Announcement Targets | Banner definitions, target segments (section, subject, individual), and schedule windows. | Administrative staff |
| Activity Signals | Interaction events (message pins, banner actions, login activity) kept for auditing. | Application telemetry |

## 3.4.2 Process

ChatBox processes transform the captured inputs into personalized communication services. Table 3.2 details the major process modules.

Table 3.2 Core processes executed by the ChatBox platform

| Process Module | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Authentication & Access Control | Verifies credentials, resolves user roles, and issues session tokens. |
| Enrollment Synchronization | Updates channel memberships when new subjects, sections, or roles are assigned. |
| Channel & Subject Management | Creates, edits, and archives channels; maps channels to academic subjects. |
| Messaging Pipeline | Persists messages, handles attachments and context metadata, and updates channel feeds. |
| Announcement & Banner Delivery | Publishes scheduled banners to targeted users, sections, or subjects and tracks acknowledgements. |
| Pinning & Highlighting | Allows moderators to pin messages and surface context for quick reference. |
| Notification & Alert Service | Dispatches in-app or email alerts for priority messages, banners, or system events. |
| Audit Logging & Analytics | Records activity logs and aggregates usage metrics for reporting. |

## 3.4.3 Output

Outputs deliver actionable communication artifacts and insights back to campus stakeholders. Table 3.3 outlines the primary outputs generated by ChatBox.

Table 3.3 Outputs produced by the ChatBox platform

| Output Artifact | Description | Primary Beneficiaries |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Real-time Channel Threads | Synchronized chat timelines with pinned highlights and context tags. | Students, faculty, office staff |
| Announcement Board | Scheduled banners and notifications segmented by role, subject, or individual targets. | Administrators, all users |
| Enrollment & Roster Views | Channel membership lists and subject enrollment summaries. | Faculty, registrars |
| Notification Feed | Alerts for new messages, pins, announcements, and system reminders. | All authenticated users |
| Activity & Compliance Logs | Exportable records of key actions for auditing and policy review. | Administrators, compliance officers |
| Engagement Analytics Snapshots | Metrics on participation, banner reach, and message volume. | Leadership, program coordinators |

> The IPO framework ensures that changes in inputs (e.g., new student cohorts, updated policies) flow through well-defined processes to deliver accurate, timely outputs that support institutional communication goals.
